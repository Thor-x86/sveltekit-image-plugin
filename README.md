# sveltekit-blog-mdx

See the [Sveltekit Blog Starter blog post on the Rodney Lab site](https://rodneylab.com/sveltekit-blog-starter/) for some explanation of what's inside and how to customise. Please drop questions into a comment at the bottom of that page. Here's the quick start:

Everything you need to build a Svelte blog site, powered by [`sveltekit-blog-mdx`](https://github.com/rodneylab/sveltekit-blog-mdx.git);

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rodneylab/sveltekit-blog-mdx.git && cd $_
pnpm install
npm run dev
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
